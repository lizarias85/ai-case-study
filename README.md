## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
  * Right now the company has introduced self-driving vehicles, however in the roll-out of this autonomous driving there have been some accidents while in autopilot mode.

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
  * Currently, one of Tesla's objectives is to provide self driving trucks for delivery and transportation of goods.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
  * Tesla is a leader in the field, however there are other companies also making efforts for autonomous trucks such as Peterbuilt and locomation to tackle the expected shortage of delivery truck drivers.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.):
  * Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),
  * Object Detection,
  * Optical Flow,
  * Lane Detection,
  * and Semantic Segmentation.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
  * I believe Tesla should incorporate the technology it uses in its sister company "Tesla solar roof" in its electric vehicles. There would be no need to stop on long road trips if the car body would be able to      absorb solar energy to charge the vehicle while in use.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
  * It would benefit the company because it would save money on the infrastructure of building charging stations. It would save drivers time if they dont have to stop to recharge. It would make the car truly self     sufficient.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
  * The metal of the car would have to be essentially a solar panel....

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
  * If the metal of the car can act as a solar panel the car would essentally charge itself if left outside, there would be no need to plug it in.
